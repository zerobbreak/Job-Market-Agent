**2. Suggested Answers (Example - Question 1)**

**Question:** "Tell me about a time you designed and built a solution that significantly improved a business process."

**Category:** Behavioral

**Likelihood:** High

**Why It's Asked:** Evaluates problem-solving skills, design capabilities, and impact on business outcomes.

**Framework:** STAR

**Answer:**

*   **Situation:** "At my previous company, a logistics firm, we were struggling with a manual, error-prone process for routing delivery vehicles. This involved manually assigning routes based on driver availability, delivery locations, and vehicle capacity, leading to delays and increased fuel costs."

*   **Task:** "My task was to design and develop an automated routing system that would optimize delivery routes, taking into account various constraints in real-time."

*   **Action:** "I designed a system using Python and the Google OR-Tools library. The system ingested data from our order management system, driver schedules, and real-time traffic data. I implemented a routing algorithm that optimized for factors like distance, delivery time windows, and vehicle capacity. I also built a user-friendly interface that allowed dispatchers to monitor and adjust routes as needed."  I also added functionality to track vehicle location and send notifications to customers.

*   **Result:** "The new system reduced delivery times by 15%, decreased fuel costs by 10%, and significantly reduced the number of delivery errors. The dispatchers were able to manage routes much more efficiently, freeing up their time for other tasks. The system was well-received by both the management and the dispatch team. We also saw an increase in customer satisfaction due to more reliable deliveries. It saved the company about R500,000 per year."
