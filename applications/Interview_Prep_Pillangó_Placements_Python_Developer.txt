**2. Suggested Answers (Key Points)**

*   **Ownership:**  "In my previous role at [Previous Company], I owned the development of a new user authentication service.  This involved designing the API, implementing the backend in Python using Flask, integrating with a PostgreSQL database, and deploying it on AWS using Docker and ECS. The result was a 40% reduction in user login errors."
*   **AWS/Terraform:** "I have extensive experience with AWS, particularly EC2, S3, Lambda, and RDS.  I've used Terraform to automate the provisioning and configuration of our entire AWS infrastructure, ensuring consistency and reproducibility across environments.  For example, I created a Terraform module to deploy a multi-tier web application with load balancing and auto-scaling."
*   **FastAPI/Backend:**  "I'm proficient with FastAPI for building RESTful APIs.  I appreciate its speed, asynchronous support, and automatic data validation.  I've used it to develop microservices that handle data processing and integration with third-party APIs. I can also work with Flask and Django."
*   **Front-end/UX:**  "I have worked with Vue.js, React, and Angular. I focus on making intuitive and efficient solutions for the user."
*   **African Context:** "I'm aware of the challenges of limited bandwidth and device capabilities in certain African regions. When designing solutions, I prioritize optimization, efficient data transfer, and responsive design to ensure a good user experience even on low-end devices and slow connections."
*   **Loadshedding:** "I know that loadshedding is a problem in South Africa. If I'm in the office, I plan on using battery backups and the company's generator. If I am working from home, I plan on having a dedicated Wifi hotspot, so I can continue to work."
