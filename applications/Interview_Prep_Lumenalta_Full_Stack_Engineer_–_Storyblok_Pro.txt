**2. Suggested Answers (Example for Question 1)**

*   **Question 1:** "Tell me about your experience leading the integration and development around Storyblok. Can you share a specific project where you successfully implemented Storyblok?"

*   **Suggested Answer:** "Certainly. In my previous role at \[Previous Company], we were tasked with rebuilding their marketing website to improve content management and website performance. We were using a traditional CMS that was difficult to manage, slow to update, and didn't provide the flexibility we needed.

    The *task* was to implement a modern, scalable, and easy-to-use CMS solution. After evaluating several options, I led the team in choosing Storyblok due to its component-based architecture, visual editor, and API-first approach.

    My *actions* involved:

    *   **Architecting the Storyblok implementation:**  I designed the content models, defined reusable components, and established best practices for content creation and management.
    *   **Leading the development team:** I guided the team in integrating Storyblok with our existing React and Next.js frontend. We built custom components to handle various content types and integrated Storyblok's API for content delivery.
    *   **Performance Optimization:** I implemented caching strategies and optimized image delivery to ensure fast website performance.
    *   **Training and Documentation:** I created documentation and training materials to help the marketing team effectively use Storyblok.

    The *result* was a significant improvement in content management efficiency.  Content updates that previously took days now took hours.  We also saw a 40% improvement in website loading speed, which positively impacted user engagement and SEO.  The marketing team was very happy with the ease of use and the flexibility Storyblok provided."
