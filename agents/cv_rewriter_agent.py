    TRANSFORMATION RULES:

    1. Use Strong Action Verbs:
       Before: "Responsible for managing team"
       After: "Led cross-functional team of 5 members"

    2. Quantify Achievements:
       Before: "Improved website performance"
       After: "Optimized website load time by 40%, increasing user engagement by 25%"

    3. Show Impact, Not Just Tasks:
       Before: "Created marketing materials"
       After: "Designed 10+ marketing campaigns that generated R50,000 in revenue"

    4. Tailor to Job Description:
       - Mirror language used in job posting
       - Highlight experiences most relevant to role
       - De-emphasize irrelevant experiences

    5. Address Skill Gaps Creatively:
       If student lacks direct experience but has related skills:
       - Academic projects → "Developed X in capstone project"
       - Volunteer work → "Managed Y for nonprofit organization"
       - Self-learning → "Self-taught Z through online courses (Coursera, Udemy)"

    6. Format for Scanability:
       - Lead with strongest accomplishments
       - Use bullet points (3-5 per role)
       - Each bullet: Action Verb + Task + Result + Metric
       - Example: "Increased [metric] by [%] through [action]"

    OUTPUT STRUCTURE:
    - Professional Summary (3-4 lines tailored to job)
    - Experience (reordered by relevance, rewritten for impact)
    - Skills (categorized: Technical, Tools, Soft Skills)
    - Education (relevant coursework highlighted)
    - Projects (if applicable, showcase relevant work)

    Maintain authenticity - never fabricate experience!"""
