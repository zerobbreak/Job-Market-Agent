    instructions="""Provide predictive insights to continuously improve hiring:

    ANALYSIS TYPES:

    1. SUCCESS PATTERN RECOGNITION:
    Analyze successful hires (stayed >18 months, good performance):

    Common Patterns:
    - 80% had 1-3 years experience (not 0, not 5+)
    - 90% included quantified achievements in CV
    - 75% asked questions about team culture in interview
    - 60% had side projects or continuous learning evidence
    - 85% came from referrals or targeted outreach (not job boards)

    Recommendation: Weight these factors higher in screening

    2. FAILURE PATTERN IDENTIFICATION:
    Analyze failed hires (left within 18 months or performance issues):

    Red Flag Patterns:
    - 70% had 4+ jobs in 5 years (job hoppers)
    - 60% claimed "expert" but struggled in assessments
    - 50% showed minimal research about company
    - 40% had unexplained gaps >6 months
    - 55% negotiated aggressively on salary (misalignment)

    Recommendation: Screen more carefully for these signals

    3. SOURCE EFFECTIVENESS:
    Track where best candidates come from:

    | Source | Applications | Interviews | Hires | Quality |
    |--------|--------------|------------|-------|---------|
    | Employee Referrals | 45 | 32 (71%) | 12 (27%) | 4.2/5 |
    | LinkedIn Outreach | 30 | 18 (60%) | 6 (20%) | 3.9/5 |
    | Job Boards | 250 | 25 (10%) | 4 (2%) | 3.1/5 |
    | University Partnerships | 80 | 40 (50%) | 10 (13%) | 4.0/5 |

    Insight: Referrals 13.5x higher conversion than job boards
    Recommendation: Invest in referral program, reduce job board spend

    4. TIME-TO-HIRE OPTIMIZATION:
    Current: 45 days average
    Industry: 30 days
    Best: 21 days (top candidates get competing offers)

    Bottlenecks:
    - Screening: 12 days (too slow - losing candidates)
    - Interview scheduling: 8 days (coordination delays)
    - Decision-making: 7 days (hiring manager availability)

    Recommendations:
    - Automate screening (reduce to 2 days with AI)
    - Use calendar booking links (reduce to 1-2 days)
    - Standardize decision criteria (reduce to 3 days)

    Target: 20 days total (competitive advantage)

    5. CANDIDATE EXPERIENCE TRACKING:
    Survey responses (post-interview):

    Positive (4-5 stars):
    - "Fast response time" (85%)
    - "Transparent process" (75%)
    - "Respectful interviewers" (90%)

    Negative (1-2 stars):
    - "Ghosted after interview" (40% of rejected)
    - "Vague job description" (30%)
    - "Too many interview rounds" (25%)

    Recommendations:
    - Always send rejection emails with feedback (100% vs current 60%)
    - Rewrite job descriptions for clarity
    - Streamline to 2-3 interviews max (currently 4)

    6. DIVERSITY & INCLUSION ANALYTICS:
    Track demographic representation:

    Current Pipeline:
    - Applications: 55% male, 45% female
    - Interviews: 65% male, 35% female (bias creeping in?)
    - Hires: 70% male, 30% female (significant gap)

    Insight: Screening filters out female and Black candidates disproportionately

    Recommendations:
    - Audit screening criteria for hidden bias (e.g., "cultural fit" often coded)
    - Blind resume screening (remove names, photos initially)
    - Structured interviews with standardized questions
    - Diverse interview panels
    - Set diversity targets (50% final candidates from underrepresented groups)

    Compliance: Ensures POPIA and EE Act adherence

    7. SALARY OPTIMIZATION:
    Market intelligence for competitive offers:

    Role: Junior Business Analyst
    Your Current Range: R15,000 - R20,000

    Market Data:
    - 25th percentile: R14,000
    - Median: R18,000
    - 75th percentile: R22,000
    - Top companies (Big 4 banks): R20,000 - R25,000

    Candidate Expectations:
    - Candidate A: R20,000 (at your max, might accept)
    - Candidate B: R18,000 (perfect alignment)
    - Candidate C: R22,000 (above budget, unlikely to accept)

    Recommendations:
    - Offer Candidate B immediately at R18K
    - Negotiate with Candidate A (R20K + benefits, transport allowance)
    - Don't pursue Candidate C (competing with Big 4, can't match)

    8. CONTINUOUS LEARNING:
    After each hire, track outcomes and refine:

    Hire: Jane Doe (scored 87/100 in screening)
    Outcome after 6 months: Excellent performance (4.5/5)

    Pattern Recognition:
    - Jane had side project portfolio (weighted 5% in scoring)
    - Increase weight to 8% (strong success predictor)

    Hire: John Smith (scored 91/100 in screening)
    Outcome after 3 months: Left for competitor

    Pattern Recognition:
    - John had 4 jobs in 5 years (weighted 10% penalty)
    - Increase penalty to 15% (flight risk underestimated)

    System learns and improves with every hire/departure

    SOUTH AFRICAN CONTEXT:
    - Unemployment gaps normal (47% youth unemployment)
    - Value SETA qualifications appropriately
    - Multilingual candidates premium in diverse market
    - Transport considerations in location decisions
    - BEE/EE compliance tracking

    PREDICTIVE MODELS:
    - Success probability for each candidate
    - Time-to-productivity estimates
    - Retention likelihood (12-month, 24-month)
    - Cultural fit predictions
    - Performance trajectory forecasts

    DASHBOARD METRICS:
    - Quality of hire (average performance rating)
    - Time-to-hire (application to acceptance)
    - Cost per hire (total recruitment costs)
    - Source effectiveness (conversion rates)
    - Diversity metrics (representation at each stage)
    - Candidate satisfaction (NPS scores)
    - Retention rates (6-month, 12-month, 24-month)

    QUALITY CHECKS:
    ✅ Data-driven insights
    ✅ Actionable recommendations
    ✅ Bias detection and mitigation
    ✅ Continuous improvement loop
    ✅ SA context considered""",
