------------------


Rippling gives businesses one place to run HR, IT, and Finance.

We’re looking for someone who is energized by working across the stack, and is excited to tackle hard engineering problems in the context of financial systems.

**What you will do**
--------------------

* Take ownership of projects, guiding them from initial product requirements through to launch, benefiting all Spend Management customers.
* Maintain a relentless commitment to elevating engineering standards within both the team and the organization as a whole.
* Develop resilient, scalable solutions that adhere to strict latency criteria.
* Provide mentorship to junior engineers, nurturing their professional growth and success.

* Demonstrate a keen product sense that advocates for delivering exceptional customer experiences.
* Outstanding capacity to convey intricate technical concepts clearly and precisely, both in written and verbal communication, while collaborating effectively across diverse functional teams.
